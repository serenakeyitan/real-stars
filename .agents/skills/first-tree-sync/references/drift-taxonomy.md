# Drift Taxonomy

Every finding produced by sync must be classified into exactly one of these
six categories. The category drives the fix workflow — see
`references/fix-workflow.md`.

## `tree-stale`

The tree node states a fact that _was_ true but is no longer. The code side
moved; the tree did not.

**Signals:** the tree references a function / file / path that the code
shows has been renamed, removed, or restructured. The tree's claim was
correct at some prior commit.

**Example:** tree node says "Auth middleware lives at `src/middleware/auth.ts`"
but the code shows it was moved to `src/auth/middleware.ts` two months ago.

**Fix bias:** code is the ground truth → update the tree.

## `tree-wrong`

The tree node states a fact that was never correct, independent of any code
movement.

**Signals:** the tree's claim cannot be traced to any commit; or it
contradicts the code at the time the node was written.

**Example:** tree node says "All endpoints return JSON" but a PR from before
the node was written introduced a streaming endpoint that returns NDJSON.

**Fix bias:** correct the tree, but check ownership — the original author
may have meant something subtler.

## `tree-outdated`

The tree node was correct, but a more recent decision supersedes it. The old
decision is not "wrong" — it has just been replaced.

**Signals:** a newer tree node, RFC, or merged PR discusses the same area
and reaches a different conclusion.

**Example:** tree node says "We use Postgres" but a migration RFC merged
last quarter switched the relevant service to ClickHouse.

**Fix bias:** mark the old node as superseded and link the new decision.
Don't delete history — preserve the rationale.

## `code-not-synced`

The code side has something the tree does not register. Split into two
subtypes because the fix shape is fundamentally different — registration
vs authorship.

### `code-not-synced/structural`

The tree's **skeleton** does not yet cover a piece of source structure
that demonstrably exists. The fix is registration, not authorship — a
stub node, a list entry, or a registry update. No decision is being
invented.

**Signals:**

- a top-level source directory has no entry in the relevant `NODE.md`
  domain list
- `.gitmodules` lists a submodule path not present in the tree's
  `source-repos.md`
- `package.json` / `pyproject.toml` / `go.mod` / `Cargo.toml` declares a
  decision-relevant dependency (framework, runtime, datastore) that is
  absent from `.first-tree/org.yaml`'s `techStackConstraints`
- a newly bound source repo is not yet registered in `source-repos.md`
- an active contributor (commits within the last 6 months) is not
  present under `members/`

**Example:** the source repo's top-level `papers/` directory exists but
the tree's `NODE.md` domain list does not mention it. Sync adds a
one-line domain entry and an empty `papers/NODE.md` stub with `title`
and `owners: []` frontmatter — no body prose.

**Fix bias:** auto-fix with the smallest correct skeleton edit. Do not
draft decision content for the new node — that is write's job on a
follow-up source pointer.

### `code-not-synced/substantive`

A merged PR / doc / `AGENTS.md` section establishes a decision,
constraint, or rationale that the tree does not record. Adding this
requires **authorship**, not registration — the "default to not writing"
filter and node-shape rules from `first-tree-write` apply.

**Signals:**

- a new RFC / decision doc lands under `docs/rfcs/`, `docs/decisions/`,
  `adr/`, or similar, with no tree counterpart
- `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` grows a new section that explains a policy,
  red line, workflow, or constraint, and the tree is silent on it
- a merged PR's body or commit message states a constraint or ownership
  rule not yet captured anywhere in the tree

**Example:** the source repo's `AGENTS.md` adds a new section on the
agent's memory-management policy; no tree node references it. Sync emits
a finding with the section heading and line range as `sourcePointer`,
and routes to `first-tree-write`. Sync never drafts the substance itself.

**Fix bias:** always hand off to `first-tree-write` with the source
pointer. Sync surfaces what should be written and stops. See
`references/boundary.md`.

## `cross-domain-broken`

A `soft_links` reference between domains is broken — the target was
renamed, removed, or moved out of the tree.

**Signals:** `tree verify` reports a broken `soft_links` target, or a
`NODE.md` references a sibling that no longer exists.

**Example:** `members/alice/NODE.md` has `soft_links: [auth/middleware]`
but `auth/middleware/NODE.md` was renamed to `auth/handlers/`.

**Fix bias:** repair the link. If the target genuinely went away, decide
whether to drop the link or replace with the new target.

## `ownership-stale`

The tree's frontmatter `owners:` list does not match the code-side reality.
A maintainer left, ownership was redistributed, or the node never had the
right owners.

**Signals:** the listed owner has not touched the code area for >6 months;
PRs in the area are reviewed by a different team; the user (in conversation)
disagrees with the listed owner.

**Example:** `auth/NODE.md` lists `[bob]` but Bob left the team and Carol
has been the de-facto reviewer for three months.

**Fix bias:** update via owner-review, not unilaterally. Ownership changes
are a high-trust operation — flag for human approval rather than auto-PR.

## Classification Rules

- A finding fits **exactly one** category. If two seem to fit, pick the
  more specific one (`tree-outdated` over `tree-stale`, `ownership-stale`
  over `tree-wrong`, `code-not-synced/substantive` over
  `code-not-synced/structural` when the gap requires authoring decision
  prose).
- If you cannot classify, the finding is not yet a drift — it is a
  question. Ask the user before reporting it.
- "The tree could be more detailed" about an existing topic is **not**
  drift. Use `first-tree-write` to deepen existing nodes. But a missing
  skeleton entry for source structure that demonstrably exists **is**
  drift — that is `code-not-synced/structural` and sync fixes it.
- Use `code-not-synced/structural` for registration (skeleton, stub,
  list entry, frontmatter). Use `code-not-synced/substantive` only when
  the fix requires composing decision prose, rationale, or constraints.

## Code Is The Ground Truth

For `tree-stale`, `tree-wrong`, `tree-outdated`, and `cross-domain-broken`,
default to merged code on the default branch as the higher-confidence
source — the proposal calls this "已合入代码上位".

The exception is a tree node whose frontmatter explicitly declares
`decisionLocksCode: true`. That is a deliberate "tree wins, escalate to a
human" marker. Treat any drift on such a node as `needs-human` regardless
of category. (This frontmatter key is reserved by the proposal but the
validator does not parse it yet — read it as plain frontmatter.)
