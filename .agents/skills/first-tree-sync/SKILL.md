description: Audit and repair drift between merged code and the Context Tree in both directions — tree→code (does code still support tree facts?) and code→tree (does the tree register everything code now contains?). Use when the tree may be stale, wrong, outdated, or missing coverage for recent code changes; after a large merge; before release; on a freshly onboarded tree; or when a GitHub notification was routed `route=sync`. Sync owns broad drift discovery, structural skeleton repair, and substantive write hand-off across one tree. Use `first-tree-write` instead when the user already gave you a specific PR / doc / note to write into the tree.

# First Tree Sync

- `../first-tree/references/functions.md`
- `../first-tree/references/maintenance.md`

## What This Skill Does

Compare a Context Tree against the source repo(s) it describes in **both
directions**:

- **tree→code** — for each tree node, does the code still support it?
  (catches `tree-stale`, `tree-wrong`, `tree-outdated`, `cross-domain-broken`,
  `ownership-stale`)
- **code→tree** — for each piece of source structure, does the tree
  register it? (catches `code-not-synced`)

Classify every gap, then route each finding to auto-fix, hand-off-to-write,
needs-human, or skip.

Two phases, in order:

1. **audit** — produce a `drifts[]` list. Read-only, human-paced. Combines
   a tree→code pass (Phase 1–3) with a code→tree sweep (Phase 4).
2. **fix** — for each drift, decide auto-fix / write-handoff / needs-human
   / skip and act on that decision.

Each phase has a dedicated reference; follow them in order.

## When To Use This Skill

| Use this skill                                       | Use a different skill                                                                |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| User asks "is the tree up to date?"                  | User has a specific PR / doc to reflect into the tree → `first-tree-write`           |
| Audit drift since a release                          | Repo is unbound → `first-tree-onboarding` first                                      |
| GitHub Scan agent routed a notification `route=sync` | Notification needs a label / comment only → `first-tree-github-scan` keeps ownership |

## The Six Drift Types

```
tree-stale                   — tree node was true; code moved
tree-wrong                   — tree node never matched code
tree-outdated                — superseded by a newer decision
code-not-synced/structural   — code structure exists; tree skeleton does not register it
code-not-synced/substantive  — code decision/constraint exists; tree does not record it
cross-domain-broken          — soft_links target gone or wrong
ownership-stale              — owners list no longer matches reality
```

`code-not-synced` has two subtypes because the fix shape is different:
structural gaps need registration (sync handles), substantive gaps need
authorship (write handles). See `references/drift-taxonomy.md`.

[references/drift-taxonomy.md](references/drift-taxonomy.md).

## How To Run

| Phase                         | Reference                                                    |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Find drift                    | [references/audit-workflow.md](references/audit-workflow.md) |
| Repair drift                  | [references/fix-workflow.md](references/fix-workflow.md)     |
| Decide between sync and write | [references/boundary.md](references/boundary.md)             |

The CLI surface this skill uses today:

- `first-tree tree inspect --json` — confirm the binding
- `first-tree tree verify` — surface broken `soft_links` and structure issues
- `git log <ref>..HEAD -- <path>` — recent-change sweep
- `gh pr create` — open the auto-fix tree PR

There is no `first-tree tree audit` command yet. The audit phase reads code
and tree manually; the fix phase opens PRs via `gh`.

## Hard Rules

- **Code is the ground truth** for `tree-stale`, `tree-wrong`,
  `tree-outdated`, `cross-domain-broken`. Override only when the node has
  `decisionLocksCode: true` in frontmatter, in which case the drift is
  always `needs-human`.
- **One drift = one PR (when auto-fixed).** Do not bundle unrelated
  findings.
- **Ownership changes are always `needs-human`.** Never auto-fix
  `owners:` lists.
- **Audit produces a list; fix takes actions.** Do not write tree updates
  inside the audit phase.
- **Sync may add structural skeletons; substantive content goes through
  write.** `code-not-synced` splits into two subtypes (see
  `references/drift-taxonomy.md`):
  - **structural** — new dir / submodule / dependency / member that the
    tree's skeleton does not yet register. Sync may auto-fix with a stub
    node or registry entry.
  - **substantive** — new decision / constraint / rationale (e.g. a new
    AGENTS.md section, a merged RFC). Sync surfaces the source pointer
    and hands off to `first-tree-write`, which applies the "default to
    not writing" filter.

  Sync never composes decision prose from code. "The tree could say more"
  about an existing topic is not drift — that is `first-tree-write`'s job.
