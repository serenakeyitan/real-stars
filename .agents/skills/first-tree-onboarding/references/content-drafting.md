# Content Drafting (Phase C)

Phase C is the agent-driven step that takes a freshly-init'd tree from "scaffolding only" to "real content drawn from the source repo". The CLI does not do this — the LLM does. This file defines exactly how.

## Detection

Phase C **fires** when any of these placeholder signals match:

- `<tree_root>/NODE.md` body contains the literal `"The living source of truth for your organization"`.
- `<tree_root>/members/owner/NODE.md` contains `"Default bootstrap member node"`.
- `<tree_root>/.first-tree/org.yaml`'s `companyContext.industry` is the empty string `""`.

Phase C **skips** when none of these strings appear. The signals come straight from the CLI's bootstrap templates — the moment a human or agent has drafted real content, at least one of them is gone.

This makes the phase idempotent — the agent can re-run the skill at any time and Phase C only does real work when there's real work to do. Do not use `<tree_root>/.first-tree/progress.md` as a Phase C signal; that file is owned by the CLI's bootstrap checklist and `tree verify` requires every line in it to be ticked. Adding an agent-driven todo there would break `init → verify`.

## Tree-on-disk resolution

Before writing anything, resolve `tree_root` to a real local path. Order of preference:

1. **Sibling dir (dedicated mode):** `<dirname(source_root)>/<treeRepoName>/`. If that exists and contains `.first-tree/`, use it.
2. **Existing local checkout (shared mode):** the path from `binding.treeMode == "shared"` plus `treeRepoName` — try sibling first, then ask the user if not found.
3. **Temp clone (URL only):** if `binding.treeRemoteUrl` is set but no local checkout exists, `git clone <url> <source_root>/.first-tree/tmp/<treeRepoName>/`. Mark this for cleanup at the end of Phase C.

Use absolute paths. Never `cd` — always pass `git -C <tree_root>`.

## Source signals (what to read)

Read **only** these. Do not browse arbitrarily.

| Signal                                   | Command / path                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Project description                      | `<source_root>/README.md` (or `Readme.md` / `README` — first match) — first H1 + first paragraph                                                                                                                    |
| Top-level layout                         | `ls -1 <source_root>` filtered to dirs, excluding `.git`, `node_modules`, `.venv`, `dist`, `build`, `target`, `.next`, `.turbo`                                                                                     |
| Manifest tech stack                      | First-found of: `package.json` (deps + devDeps top-level keys), `pyproject.toml` (`[project.dependencies]`), `Cargo.toml` (`[dependencies]`), `go.mod` (`require` block), `Gemfile`, `pom.xml`, `requirements*.txt` |
| Recent contributors                      | `git -C <source_root> log --since='6 months ago' --format='%aN <%aE>' \| sort \| uniq -c \| sort -rn \| head -20`                                                                                                   |
| Repo metadata                            | `gh repo view --json description,topics,homepageUrl,defaultBranchRef` (skip if `gh auth status` failed)                                                                                                             |
| Workspace children (workspace-root only) | `<source_root>/source-repos.md` if present, else discovered child repos from inspect                                                                                                                                |

If any signal is missing or empty, that's fine — record "unavailable" and lower confidence on dependent fields.

## Extraction rules (signal → tree field)

For each output field below, apply the rule. Confidence is `high` / `medium` / `low`. Mark every `low` field with `# unverified — source: <signal>` so the user knows what to review.

### `<tree_root>/NODE.md`

| Tree field                               | Rule                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Confidence                                |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `## Domains` list                        | One bullet per top-level dir that looks like a domain (`apps/`, `packages/`, `services/`, `libs/`, `cmd/`, `internal/`). Skip build artifacts (`dist`, `node_modules`, `.next`, `.venv`). Use the dir name as the domain title. | medium                                    |
| Description paragraph above `## Domains` | Verbatim from README first paragraph if it's ≤ 3 sentences. Otherwise summarize in ≤ 30 words and quote source.                                                                                                                 | high if README exists; low if synthesized |

Do **not** invent domains that don't exist as dirs. If the repo has only `src/`, the tree has only one domain — that's correct.

### `<tree_root>/members/owner/NODE.md`

| Tree field            | Rule                                                                                                                                                                            | Confidence |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| `title` frontmatter   | Most-frequent contributor's `%aN` from `git log`                                                                                                                                | high       |
| Body                  | One sentence: "Owner of the `<source_repo>` source repo." Plus a `## Recent contributors` list (top 5 from `git log` with commit counts), each as `- Name <email> (N commits)`. | high       |
| `domains` frontmatter | Default `[core]`. Only override if user has named multiple domains (rare in initial draft).                                                                                     | high       |

Do **not** create new `members/<name>/` nodes for other contributors in the initial draft — the owner-only roster is the safe default. Adding more members is a follow-up the user does explicitly.

### `<tree_root>/.first-tree/org.yaml`

| Tree field                                       | Rule                                                                                                                                                                                    | Confidence |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| `companyContext.industry`                        | Inferred from README first paragraph + repo description + topics. Set to a single phrase (`"developer tools"`, `"data infra"`, etc.). If unclear, leave `""` and add `# unverified`.    | low        |
| `companyContext.stage`                           | If `package.json` `version` < `0.1.0` → `"prototype"`. If between `0.1.0` and `1.0.0` → `"alpha"`. If ≥ `1.0.0` → `"production"`. If no version field → leave `""` with `# unverified`. | medium     |
| `companyContext.techStackConstraints`            | Top 5 entries from manifest deps (the most-used languages/frameworks). Format: `- <name>` (e.g., `- typescript`, `- react`, `- postgres`).                                              | high       |
| `companyContext.culture`                         | Leave `[]` with comment `# unverified — culture is a human input`.                                                                                                                      | always low |
| `agents`                                         | Leave `[]`. The daemon writes here; not a draft target.                                                                                                                                 | n/a        |
| `collaboration.routing` / `collaboration.review` | Leave `[]` with `# unverified — author later`.                                                                                                                                          | n/a        |
| `humanInvolveRules.defaults`                     | Keep the default 3 entries.                                                                                                                                                             | high       |

### `<tree_root>/source-repos.md`

This file is regenerated by the CLI from the managed code-repo registry block. **Do not write it by hand in Phase C.** If it's missing or stale, run `first-tree tree integrate --tree-path <tree_root>` (or whichever CLI command syncs it for the current binding mode).

### `<tree_root>/AGENTS.md` and `<tree_root>/CLAUDE.md`

Both contain managed blocks (`<!-- BEGIN FIRST-TREE-TREE-IDENTITY -->` and others). **Phase C does not touch these.** They are owned by the CLI.

The free-form section below `# Project-Specific Instructions` IS editable in Phase C, but only add content if the source repo has a non-trivial AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md whose content is worth carrying over to the tree's instructions. Otherwise leave the placeholder comment alone.

## Confidence and `# unverified` markers

Every field marked `low` confidence must include an inline comment in the file:

```yaml
companyContext:
  industry: "" # unverified — source: README.md has no industry signal
  stage: "alpha" # unverified — package.json version 0.3.1 → alpha (medium confidence)
```

For markdown nodes, use HTML comments at the end of the line or paragraph:

```markdown
The bingran-you workspace hosts agent infrastructure prototypes. <!-- unverified — synthesized from README L1-3 -->
```

These comments are intentional: they tell the user where to review and why.

## Delivery (commit, branch, PR)

Default flow — **always show diff before remote actions**:

1. `git -C <tree_root> checkout -b chore/initial-content-draft`
2. Make all edits, then `git -C <tree_root> add -A` and `git -C <tree_root> diff --staged`.
3. **Stop and show the diff to the user.** Wait for "yes / no / edit X" before any remote action.
4. On approval:
   - `git -C <tree_root> commit -m "chore: draft initial tree content from source signals" -m "$BODY"` where `$BODY` lists the source signals used per field.
   - `git -C <tree_root> push -u origin chore/initial-content-draft`
   - `gh pr create --repo <owner/treeRepo> --title "Draft initial tree content" --body "..."` — body must list per-field provenance and flag every `# unverified` field for the user to review.
5. After the PR is open (or merged, if the user prefers direct push to main): do **not** modify `progress.md` — that file is the CLI's bootstrap checklist and any unchecked line there will fail `tree verify`. Phase C state is observed via the placeholder strings in §Detection.

If the tree is not yet published to a remote (Phase B happened on a fresh local-only sibling), commit locally and tell the user how to publish + push the branch manually. Don't run `gh repo create` without explicit user approval.

## Cleanup

If `tree_root` was a temp clone in `<source_root>/.first-tree/tmp/<treeRepoName>/`, remove it after the push completes. The managed `AGENTS.md` block in the source repo says clones in `tmp/` are local-only state — never commit them.

## Idempotency

Re-running Phase C on an already-drafted tree is safe:

- Detection signals all evaluate false → Phase C skips.
- If a partial draft landed (e.g., NODE.md and members/owner/NODE.md were rewritten but `org.yaml` `companyContext.industry` is still the empty string), Phase C re-fires and writes only the fields whose placeholder still matches. Re-read source signals, re-apply rules for the missing fields, generate a follow-up commit, open another PR.

Never overwrite content that has already been edited (signal: the placeholder string is gone AND no `# unverified` marker remains on that field). Treat that as "human-finalized".

## What Phase C does NOT do

- Does not start the daemon (Phase D).
- Does not modify agent templates (Phase E).
- Does not register source repos (handled by `tree integrate` / `tree workspace sync`).
- Does not run any LLM call beyond what the agent itself does. There is no separate LLM service the skill calls.
- Does not deduce facts not present in the source signals listed above. If something can't be inferred, leave it empty with `# unverified`.
